History of Altitudini
-----

In a time of great conflict between two major clans, two players from opposing sides chose to abandon their armies in search of more peaceful pastures. Upon this fateful act of desertion, these players found themselves joining together to evade the two legions of knights sent to hunt them down. Some time later they had been chased into a vast desert, faced with the new problem of resource scarcity. Block after block of sand and gravel forced them to dig deep, both into the ground and into their stamina. When all hope seemed lost, they woke up out of a sandstorm to discover a most majestic and vast rainforest. Graced with refreshing pools and ripe fruits, they found refuge by learning to live harmoniously with the trees, and with nature itself. Soon, with the wood of a recently fallen oak, these pioneers ascended to live and see the world from a new height - and so the first block of Altitudini was placed.

Nowadays, Altitudiniâ€™s iconic treehouses are seen as outrageously fashionable, prompting heavy waves of tourism and immigration. Due to its remote location, it became the first destination to receive a railway link before a road. To this day, the citizens of Altitudini stay true to its founding beliefs, building only from sustainable materials, and building above the ground and its biodiverse ecosystem.
