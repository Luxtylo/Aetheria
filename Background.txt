The Lore of Aetheria
-----

Aetheria is a country founded around the idea of the Aether - a theoretical opposite to the Nether. The founders of the country believed that since the only known portals went to the Nether (and later, the End, a "neutral" world) that there must be something to balance out the "badness" of the Nether. Thus their goal became to make the overworld the opposite of the Nether, a heaven-like place. They called it Aetheria.

Before the founding of Aetheria, the area was occupied by several warring clans. Eventually they united under the flag of Aetheria to form the greatest alliance this world has ever seen.

It took a long time to build. Starting from Aetheria castle, the country slowly moved outwards, eventually encompassing everything from the great forest in the Northwest to the huge deserts to the South and East. The terrain of Aetheria is beautiful and varied, and offers a place for anyone who wishes to live there.

--Insert history here--

After several hundred years of peace, the surrounding countries went to war with Aetheria, and eventually became locked in a stalemate which lasted 23 years, neither crossing the other's borders. Eventually the dispute (originally over who owned a river - neither side could agree who owned which parts) was settled peacefully, and the peace returned. In the 200 years since then, there has not been any sign of an impending war.
