The lore of Aetheria
-----

Aetheria is a country founded around the idea of the Aether - a theoretical opposite to the Nether. The founders of the country believed that since the only known portals went to the Nether (and later, the End, a "neutral" world) that there must be something to balance out the "badness" of the Nether. Thus their goal became to make the overworld the opposite of the Nether, a heaven-like place. They called it Aetheria.
